### Step 2: Customize

Add your own phrases for your contestants to use.
  - Modify the `levels` dictionary in the main.py.
  - After each number is a sentence that your user will be typing.
  - Change what is inside the triple quotes (''') starting on line 29 to change the text.

Here is an example of changing the `levels` dictionary.

  levels = {
  1:'''print("hello world")''',
  ```
