### Step 2: Customize

Add your own phrases for your contestants to use.
  - Modify the `levels` dictionary, after each number is a sentence that your user will be typing - change what's inside the `'''    '''` parts to change the text.
  ```python
  levels = {
  1:'''print("hello world")''',
  ```
